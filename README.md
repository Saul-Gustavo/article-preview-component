## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

### Screenshot

### Mobile Version

![screenshot-mobile](images/screenshot-mobile.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

Cuando estaba en el proceso de crear el proyecto, me sentia que no podia hacerlo, que estaba muy complicado, porque se me dificultaba poner el evento de Share 
cuando se hacia click en el, pero se que con practica, que aun me falta mucho y con estos mini proyectos, se que puedo mejorar, pero aun me falta un gran camino por recorrer. Me esforzare para cumplir mis objetivos.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="share-icon" id="compart">
  <img src="images/icon-share.svg" alt="icon-share">
</div>
```
```css
.social {
    background-color: var(--very-dark-grayish-blue);
    position: absolute;
    top: -70px;
    right: -80px;
    padding: 1em;
    border-radius: .5em;
    display: none;
}

.social::after {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: 100%;
    left: 50%;
    margin-left: 10px;
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
    border-top: 10px solid var(--very-dark-grayish-blue);
    border-left: 10px solid transparent;
    border-right: 10px solid transparent
}
```
